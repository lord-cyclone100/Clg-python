'''A studentâ€™s grade is calculated in a subject according to the following rules:
Number Obtained         Grade
>=90 and <=100          O
>=80 and <90            E
>=70 and <80            A
>=60 and <70            B
>=50 and <60            C
>=40 and <50            D
<40 and >=0             F(FAILED)
Others No.              INVALID
Write a Python script which accepts a studentâ€™s marks as an input and then determine
the grade of the students in that subject.'''
