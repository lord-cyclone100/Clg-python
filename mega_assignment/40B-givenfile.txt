Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and allows developers to express concepts with fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Its extensive standard library provides modules and packages for diverse tasks, enhancing productivity.
Python's interpreter and dynamic typing contribute to rapid development cycles.
Widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation, Python's community-driven development model fosters a rich ecosystem, making it a preferred choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.
